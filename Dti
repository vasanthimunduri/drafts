How Real Estate Fraud Happens in India (Specific Tactics Used)

Here’s how fraudsters trick buyers:

1️⃣ Fake Land Ownership Documents

Fraudsters forge title deeds and sell government or disputed land.

Many create fake property registration papers and resell the same land to multiple buyers.


✅ Example: A family in Tirupati paid ₹50 lakh for land, only to find it was already owned by the government. The agent disappeared.

2️⃣ Overpricing & Manipulated Market Rates

Sellers and agents inflate land prices far beyond fair value.

Buyers have no reliable way to verify market rates.


✅ Example: A farmer was offered ₹20 lakh for land, but a real estate agent later sold it for ₹60 lakh—keeping ₹40 lakh as profit.

3️⃣ No Digital Land Records, Manual Tampering

Andhra Pradesh’s land records are not fully digitized.

Government databases are prone to tampering & corruption.


✅ Example: A buyer checked land records at a local office, but the records were manually changed later to show a different owner.

4️⃣ Selling Land That Doesn’t Exist

Some sell land in non-existent projects with fake brochures.

Victims realize the scam after paying lakhs in advance.


✅ Example: A company in Vijayawada collected ₹10 crore from 200+ buyers for plots in a fake township that was never built.

5️⃣ Fake Promises of “Future Development”

Agents claim “this area will get an airport/highway soon” to inflate prices artificially.

Many buyers invest in barren land based on fake promises.


✅ Example: Investors in Andhra Pradesh bought plots based on rumors of an IT park, which never happened. Prices later crashed by 70%.
